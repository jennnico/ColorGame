# ColorGame

React JS project

This activity allows ESL students to practice vocabulary with minimal supervision. Students match the word with the displayed color.

-The Square component is rendered in the root element. Only one component was needed for this simple project.

-The square appears in one of six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple). The color is randomly selected using Math.floor(Math.random()) and set using this.state. The color is changed using this.setState

-The checkMatch function checks to see if the color the user clicked matches this.state.backgroundColor
