# ColorGame

React JS project

This game was created for ESL students.  Students must match the color with the corresponding word.

-This includes 2 components: the Color component stores the color words, and the Square component stores the color.

-The square appears in one of six colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple). The color is randomly selected using Math.floor(Math.random()).
